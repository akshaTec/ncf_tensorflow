# ncf_tensorflow
TensorFlow Implementation of Neural Collaborative Filtering

This repo is the tensorflow implementation of Neural Collaborative Filtering by Xiangnan He, 2017. It maintains the parameters and initializations just as in the original [repo](https://github.com/hexiangnan/neural_collaborative_filtering). Also, the datasets are used from the original repo as well. 
The repo also includes a notebook for the implementation of ncf_tensorflow on Movielens-1M dataset on a kaggle notebook.
